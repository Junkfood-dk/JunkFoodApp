# string_cache

A Flutter package for fetching and caching localized strings from Supabase. Designed to work as a drop-in replacement for Flutter's built-in app_localizations.
All strings will be persisted locally using the drift
package.

When new or updated strings are fetched from Supabase,
they will overwrite any existing strings in the local
cache.

---

## Features

- Persist strings locally using `drift`.
- Simple interface for saving, retrieving, and clearing cached strings.
- Lightweight and dependency-minimal.

## Supabase

- Strings table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE strings (
  id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  key text NOT NULL,
  value text NOT NULL,
  language text NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamp WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at timestamp WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  CONSTRAINT unique_key_language UNIQUE (key, language)
);
```

- Possible values for the 'language' column are 'da' or 'en'

## Installation

Add `string_cache` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  string_cache:
    path: ../string_cache # For local development
